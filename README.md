# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the course project for the coursera class "Getting and Cleaning Data". This project is meant to demonstrate the skills learned in the class for cleaning data into a more readable format.

This repository contains:

1.  The data sets retrieved from the UCI machine learning repository on "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones"
2.  The README.md file loosely describing the project
3.  The CodeBook.md file explaining more in depth about methodology
4.  The tidy data set describing the data in a more readable format
5.  The run_analysis.R file that was used to create the tidy data set.

All data comes from: <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>

The data zip file was provided by the class through the download link: <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>

The tasks that we were told to perform using our R script were:

1.  Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
2.  Extract only the mean and standard deviation measurements
3.  Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately label the variable names with descriptive variable names
5.  Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
